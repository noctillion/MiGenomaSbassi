Introduction
------------

This git repository contains the genetic information for Sebastian Bassi, as raw data provided by 23andme.com.

As far as I know, I am the first Argentine in releasing his genomic data for free to share to the world (see license terms at the end of this file).

This dataset contains about 1M genetic markers that can be used to study resistance to diseases, carrier status of several conditions and physical traits. I am releasing this data following Manu Sporny example (http://manu.sporny.org/2011/public-domain-genome/), with the same wish: Helping researchers to know more about human genetics and helping open source developers like me with real data to play with.

About me: I am a biotechnologist working as a software developer at Globant. I am author of DNALinux.com, py4bio.com (Python for Bioinformatics book) and contributed to Biopython. I live in Argentina with my wife Virginia Gonzalez and my son Maximo Bassi, but I am currently working in Glendale, California.
